Having only gotten one review so far,
the main thing that I could have done
better is describe the functions. My
current comments consist of nothing
but the type signiture of the functions,
done in the haskell way, in that they
use currying notation. The other main
issue that was brought up was using 
else instead of cons? in cond branches
but I think this is more a matter of 
style than anything, and I think I'll
keep doing it that way. I also liked
the (max 0 val) trick that I saw in
another assignment, and wish I had
done it that way.
